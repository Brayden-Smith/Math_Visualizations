This code takes a sequences of functions and checks for a sampling of points between 0 and 1 how far into the sequence it will take 
to be within any given epsilon range. It will then take this data and plot it.

You can use The shape of the graph to help understand why one sequence might be uniformly convergent while another is pointwise convergent.

Included is a test for epsilon one tenth and one-hundreth for the sequence x^n. also included is the epsilon one-tenth for the sequence x/n.
